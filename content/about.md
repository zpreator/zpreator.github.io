# About Me

I'm a Machine Learning Engineer with {YEARS}+ years of experience building and deploying ML models in production. I completed my MS in Computer Science with focus on AI & Machine Learning from Colorado State University in 2024, building on my mechanical engineering foundation that provides robust analytical skills for tackling ML problems from first principles.

At Cricut, I've developed novel semantic font search systems using fine-tuned CLIP models and successfully deployed ML recommendation models serving thousands of daily users. Previously at Autoliv, I built CNN-based computer vision tools, full-stack web applications, and led cross-functional teams implementing advanced ML techniques for manufacturing analytics. I'm passionate about solving hard technical problems through deep research and persistent focus.
